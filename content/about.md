# About Me
Hey there! I'm DeLuks, the guy behind "Magic Bytes". Here's a bit about who I am and what you can expect from this blog:

## Who Am I?
I'm just a nerd with a interest in Malware development, reverse engineering, cybersecurity and low level programming.

## Why "Magic Bytes"?
Magic Bytes was created out of my desire to share my experiences and discoveries while learning about malware development, reverse engineering, cybersecurity, etc.. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast or just curious about the stuff I write about, I hope you find something valuable here.

## What to Expect?
Expect a mix of that aim to inform and maybe even inspire you. I believe in learning by doing (which means that I will try to add some homework for yall :P ), and I'm very happy to take you on this journey with me.
